						<h2 align="left">About Sienar Fleet Systems</h2> 
						<h4 align="left">Bringing you only the finest in starfleet systems and support for over fifteen millennia.</h4>
						<!-- <img src="images/Sienarfinal.png"> -->
						<p><strong>“Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side”</strong> This post-Republic slogan speaks to the Sienar fleet spirit of innovation in the face of disaster. As the Republic fell into civil war we were there fighting for peace; saving lives on the front-lines as we, with many others, brought forth the greatest technological advances since the Great Hyperspace war. Our innovations in Ion propulsion and starship manufacturing saved millions as our navies stood in opposition of the separatists on hundreds of worlds throughout space. </p>

						<p>With the reorganization of the Old Republic into the Galactic Empire, Sienar fleet systems was merged into the Imperial logistics and engineering division under the leadership of Raith Sienar and Valles Santha. Sienar Fleet Systems works closely with our sister company Sienar Design Systems to design and build cutting edge ships from the ground up. This allows us to pay special attention and care to our products at each stage of development ensuring that only the highest quality products reach our customers. Sienar has a rich history of starship design reaching back over 15 millennia and including many famous designs throughout time, such as the star galleon and the Leviathan class destroyer.</p>

						<p>We feel proud to be manufacturing our most current line of vessels including the Imperial line of Star destroyers and the diverse TIE family of star fighters. We are also proud to unveil the newest member of the Star destroyer family, the Executor-class: Super-star destroyer dreadnaught. Darth Vader himself has made the Executor his personal flagship and the Imperial navy has commissioned a line of dreadnaughts be put into operation within 4 solar years to combat the rising rebel activity in the outer-rim systems. So with many new opportunities opening up for Sienar we are working closely with the folks at the Kuat and Fondor drive-yards to complete these monumental projects. </p>
